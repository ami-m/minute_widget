# minute_widget
This is a small jquery plugin that takes a simple html input, and adds two sliders after it to the dom.
the original input represents a time period in minutes, and the two sliders represent that same amount of time as hours + minutes.

Updating the sliders updates the original input.

(just see the demo page)
